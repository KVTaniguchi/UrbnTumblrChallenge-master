UrbnTumblrChallenge - reloaded
===================

Kevin Taniguchi's URBN Tumblr Challenge


Usage of cocoa pods and third party libraries is fine
Enter a username or tumblr url to load a user's feed
Display feed items for all posts
Feed should be infinitely scrollable collection view supporting a way to refresh
If the post originated from another user, I should be able to tap another users avatar/user to transition to that users feed using a custom navigation transition
Full HTML rendering of posts (without web view)
Client side persistence for using core data
App should properly update when coming in and out of active states
App should be resilient to loss of network connectivity where possible
Unit tests are encouraged
Use of animations are encouraged
All code should be in Github
